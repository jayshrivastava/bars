Although my heart is falling too,Ed Sheeran
And how your family is doing okay,Ed Sheeran
And last night you were in my room,Ed Sheeran
And now my bed sheets smell like you,Ed Sheeran
"And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like",Ed Sheeran
And trust me I'll give it a chance now,Ed Sheeran
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me,Ed Sheeran
"Come on now, follow my lead",Ed Sheeran
"Come on, be my baby, come on",Ed Sheeran
"Come, come on now, follow my lead",Ed Sheeran
Drinking fast and then we talk slow,Ed Sheeran
Every day discovering something brand new,Ed Sheeran
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate,Ed Sheeran
"Girl, you know I want your love",Ed Sheeran
Grab on my waist and put that body on me,Ed Sheeran
"I may be crazy, don't mind me",Ed Sheeran
I'm in love with the shape of you,Ed Sheeran
I'm in love with your body,Ed Sheeran
Last night you were in my room,Ed Sheeran
"Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat",Ed Sheeran
Me and my friends at the table doing shots,Ed Sheeran
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I,Ed Sheeran
One week in we let the story begin,Ed Sheeran
"Say, boy, let's not talk too much",Ed Sheeran
So the bar is where I go,Ed Sheeran
"Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox",Ed Sheeran
"Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like",Ed Sheeran
The club isn't the best place to find a lover,Ed Sheeran
We push and pull like a magnet do,Ed Sheeran
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour,Ed Sheeran
We're going out on our first date,Ed Sheeran
"You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat",Ed Sheeran
Your love was handmade for somebody like me,Ed Sheeran
Although my heart is falling too,Ed Sheeran
