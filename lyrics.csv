I went away for months until our paths crossed again,Ed Sheeran
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch,Ed Sheeran
"It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest",Ed Sheeran
It's not like we were both on tour,Ed Sheeran
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten,Ed Sheeran
"Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing",Ed Sheeran
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her,Ed Sheeran

Then I put it on pause until the moment was right,Ed Sheeran
This is not the way you realised what you wanted,Ed Sheeran
Trust and respect is what we do this for,Ed Sheeran
"Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course",Ed Sheeran
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza,Ed Sheeran
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor,Ed Sheeran
"We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""",Ed Sheeran
"When she was kissing him, how I was confused about",Ed Sheeran
"Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out",Ed Sheeran
